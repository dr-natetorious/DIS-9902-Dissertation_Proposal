Bringing together evidence across studies first requires a search of the literature; this is one of the early steps in what is sometimes called a “systematic review  (Ozier, 2021).” With a set of studies in hand, the next step in the review may (or may not) be a statistical approach to analyzing the published findings, usually called “metaanalysis” or a variant thereof. Different disciplines emphasize different aspects of this process and afford the process-different levels of scholarly prominence  (Ozier, 2021).
