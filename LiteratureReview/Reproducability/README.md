# Reproducability challenges in ML

## The Challenge of Reproducible ML (2021)

E. Rivera-Landos, F. Khomh and A. Nikanjam, "The Challenge of Reproducible ML: An Empirical Study on The Impact of Bugs," 2021 IEEE 21st International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS), 2021, pp. 1079-1088, doi: 10.1109/QRS54544.2021.00116. [EmpiricalStudy.pdf](EmpiricalStudy.pdf).

The authors state that only 25% of deep learning papers contain code, and most repositories are unusable. One study found that 9% of surveyed papers **could** be reproduced, not wheather the results match.

They talk about the need for seeding data, which is good suggestion.

## Reproducibility in deep learning algorithms (2020)
